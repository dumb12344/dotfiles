# Arch Dotfiles
Intended to be installed after a minimal system is setup (e.g. archinstall with minimal profile)

One-liner if you have git:

```git clone https://github.com/dumb12344/dotfiles.git && cd dotfiles && ./install.sh```

If you don't:
```
pacman -Sy git --needed
git clone https://github.com/dumb12344/dotfiles.git
cd dotfiles
./install.sh
```

(idk if this works on a distro other than arch)
